## Caution: Stack Size Limit Exceeded

When working with recursive functions, especially in JavaScript or TypeScript, it's important to be aware of the possibility of encountering a "Stack Size Limit Exceeded" error. This error occurs when the call stack, which keeps track of function calls, becomes too deep due to excessive recursion, ultimately causing the program to crash.
